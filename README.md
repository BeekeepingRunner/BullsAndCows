# BullsAndCows

An extended solution to one of the excercises from 
Bjarne Strostrup's "Programming Principles and Practice Using C++ (2nd edition, 2014)"

Game rules:

User try to guess a randomly drawn 4 digit number (digits are different from each other).
If a digit in a guess is on the correct position in the number drawn, it's considered as a "bull".
If a digit in a guess is in the number drawn, but not on the right position, it's considered as a "cow".

User is notified about the number of bulls and cows in his guess
and plays until there are 4 bulls in a guess (the guess is correct).

Game has been extended with a version with letters instead of digits. Rules stay the same.
